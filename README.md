# Minimal Boilerplate for Web Apps
I found myself forgetting a lot of small details when attempting to quickly generate and deploy (mostly Django) web applications with a React frontend using Apache - so I decided to collect some of the basic files and info here.

## Structure
The app architecture is made up of a django project for doing backend stuff,
and a react app setup for most of the views. Includes a config
for apache web server.
